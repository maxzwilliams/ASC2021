\title{Why didnt the Lax-Wendroff Scheme work?}

\section*{Why?}
We have our advection diffusion equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + (\vec{u} \cdot \nabla) T = \kappa \nabla^2 T + \frac{Q}{C_p}.
\end{equation}
I used central space schemes and a forward Euler scheme for time. Using this forward Euler scheme for time creates an unconditionally unstable scheme.
\newline
My first attempt to fix this was using the Lax wendroff scheme. However, this introduces an additional diffusive term. The scheme was stable, but not accurate. So I moved on.
