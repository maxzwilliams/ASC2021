\section*{Overview}
The lattice-boltzman method (LBM) is a numerical method for solving fluid flows. Traditional techniques such as the streamfunction-vorticity approach or SIMPLE algorithm and its derivatives employ discritization of macroscopic fluid equations and aim to solve these either directly in the 2 dimensional streamfunction vorticity approach or via smoothing of macroscopic parameters. The lattice botlzman method simulates the motion and position of the basic constituents of the fluid, particles and shows the macroscopic affects through emergent phenomena.
