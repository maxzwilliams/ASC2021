\section*{What is this?}
Quick notes on what I remember from each meeting. 

\section*{10th of September 2021}
\subsection*{General Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $p = p_{hydrostatic}$ will not work. It does not account for dynamic pressure terms. We need a more complex method.
	\item Read some engineering texts on how they typically deal with these pressure terms
	\item Look at the stream function approach in 2D. Should be pretty simple to code this up. Look at the affect of the inner boundry on results of the code.
	\item Read the two papers on the lattice-boltzman method. Might look at solving the full 3D problem like this
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Main goals for this week}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A broad understanding of how other people solve these problems
	\item A simple 2D simulation
	\item An approximate path for solving this problem
\end{enumerate}
